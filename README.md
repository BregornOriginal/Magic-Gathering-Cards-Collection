# Collection of Magic Gathering Cards.

***This is a capstone project for Microverse of React/Redux Module.***

***In this project, the requirement were to follow a disign as example to show on the home page a list of elements that was getted from an API.***

***Each element should have a property to be filtered, so we have to create a filter to filter this property.***

***In this page you can see how I create a filter to create the cards depending on the type of them.***

***I only bring from the API 100 cards because there were like 1000 cards or more, so I'm only showing a part of all the cards that the game has.***

***I'm proud to create this project by working with the redux and storing the data from the API inside of it, so I could use it to work on the different pages of the website.***
 
> I have this example to follow [DESIGN](https://www.behance.net/gallery/31579789/Ballhead-App-(Free-PSDs)).

> I used [this API](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/). to fetch the cards data project.

> Special thanks to Nelson Sakwa on Behance for providing the design!

In this case I will create the Home page and the Details page of each card for mobile (up to 768px wide).

## Home page

✅ When the page loads, the webapp load the list of cards from the API selected.

✅ Along with the category name, there is displayed the Converted Mana Cost to converte a Card's Mana.

✅ When the user clicks (or taps) on a category item, the application navigates to the details page.

## Detail Page

✅ In the details page, the webapp retrieves data from the API to show detailed data in the category.

✅ When the user clicks on the "Back" button (<) or in the logo icon, the user navigates to the home page.
